*This figure shows different representations of 3D data. (A) Point cloud; (B) Voxel grid; (C) Triangular grid; (D) Multi-view representation*

- **Point cloud**: A set of points in 3D space. The points may present a 3D object or shape. Each point is determined by a certain (x,y,z) position in a 3D coordinates system [^1].
- **Voxel grid**: The voxel grid is a geometry type. In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular 3D grid and can be seen as a counterpart to the pixel in 2D. Also, we can regard voxel grid as a quantized point cloud with a fixed size.
- **Polygon mesh**: A polygon mesh a set of convex polygonal surfaces defined by a collection of vertices, edges and faces. A polygon mesh defines the shape and contour of every 3D object. In figure(c), the object in constructed by triangular mesh.
- **Multi-view representation**: This approach uses rendered images with multiple cameras represent the 3D object.
