- **Point cloud**: A set of points in 3D space. The points may present a 3D object or shape. Each point is determined by a certain (x,y,z) position in a 3D coordinates system [^1].
- **Voxel grid**: The voxel grid is a geometry type. In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular 3D grid and can be seen as a counterpart to the pixel in 2D. Also, we can regard voxel grid as a quantized point cloud with a fixed size.
- **Triangular grid**:
